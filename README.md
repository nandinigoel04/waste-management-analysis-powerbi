# Waste Management Analysis (Power BI Dashboard)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of waste generation patterns using **Power BI**.  
The dataset (October 2025) includes waste type, area, household type, waste quantity, and source details.  
The goal of this project is to identify major waste contributors and propose key strategies for reducing waste.

This project was created for my **college event – Project Ace**, as part of my interest in **Data Analytics and Data Science**.
